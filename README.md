- 👋 Hi, I’m Jerry Gentry!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning from data to make the world a better place.  I love to see what's working and what isn't and help adjust to better myself and others!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning skills to help me enter the field of data analytics.  I've worked on SQL and Tableau and am currently learning Python and R!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!  I'm new to the field but learning quickly and excited to grow my skills and network!
